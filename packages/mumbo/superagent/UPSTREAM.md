# Upstream copy and modification log

`@mumbo/superagent` is a pinned copy of https://github.com/deepseek-ai/dsh-superagent-prototype at commit `8c32a9dc5d72c033816c6a8110b37f40cf94fba4`, MIT licensed (see `LICENSE`).

Every change to the copy is an entry below. A path outside `packages/mumbo/superagent/` that exists for the copy is listed too. Oxlint ignores `packages/mumbo/superagent/**`; S1 lists the other repository gate exclusions.

## S1: port and packaging

Upstream targets dsh `0.2.1-alpha.2` and builds as a standalone package. The copy builds inside this repository at `0.2.2-rc.1`.

Files not copied: upstream `tsdown.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `scripts/` and `tests/service-script.spec.ts`. Upstream `README.md` is `docs/upstream-readme.md`.

Added: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.host.json`, `tsconfig.client.json`, `tsdown.config.ts`, `src/client/css-modules.d.ts` (replaces `src/client/css.d.ts`), the package README pair `README.md`, `README.zh.md` and `README.i18n.yaml`, the plugin metadata `locale/{ja,es,fr,de,ru,pt}.json`, and this file.

Edits to the copy:

- `package.json`: private `@mumbo/superagent` at the repository version `0.2.2-rc.1`; `workspace:*` and `workspace:~` dependency ranges; the packages `cordis.patch.yml` names are `dependencies`; `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection` as peer and dev dependency; `lib/types` declarations; `files` lists `lib/*.js`, which includes the chunks the three entries share.
- `tsconfig.json` is solution-only. `tsconfig.host.json` and `tsconfig.client.json` turn off `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters`, which upstream never enabled (commented in each file). The host leaf excludes `src/client` and `src/navigation.ts` (client only). The client leaf includes all of `src` with Node types and the union of both leaves' references, because the shared client modules import host view types; it does not reference the host leaf.
- `src/index.ts`: `import type {} from '@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-connection'`.
- `src/infra/paths.ts`: `packageRoot()` matches `@mumbo/superagent`.
- `cordis.patch.yml`: the plugin row names are `@mumbo/superagent`, `@mumbo/superagent/github-watch` and `@mumbo/superagent/feishu-watch`. Row ids and preset ids are unchanged.
- `src/client/provider.tsx`: the stylesheet import is `?inline`, as `packages/client/tsdown.client.ts` provides.
- Documentation links in `src/deployment.ts`, `src/setup.ts`, `src/app/http.ts` and `src/client/locales.ts` are relative to the repository root (`packages/mumbo/superagent/docs/...`).
- `docs/007-architecture.md` lists `css-modules.d.ts` and no longer lists `tests/service-script.spec.ts`. `tests/docs.spec.ts` checks `SETUP.md` as the only entry document because `README.md` is this repository's package README, not an upstream document.
- Tests that read `process.cwd()` (`tests/controls.spec.tsx`, `tests/styles.spec.ts`) read relative to the spec file, so they pass from the repository root.
- Owner-admitting `connection: { admit: ... }` on the web server fake in `tests/fixtures/host.ts`, `tests/runtime.spec.ts` and `tests/model-surface.spec.ts`.
- API drift against dsh `0.2.2-rc.1`:
  - `src/app/http.ts`: the comment on the state response no longer cites `scripts/dsh-superagent`, which is not copied. `webServer.port` is `number | undefined`; an unbound port never matches a request origin.
  - `src/app/resources.ts`: `SessionController.inspect` no longer exists; the ticket transcript is read through `sessionPersistence.open(id, 'read')` pages. The fakes drop `inspect`; `tests/tools.spec.ts` feeds the transcript through the fixture's persistence reader.
  - `src/app/role-models.ts`: `agent/request` may no longer change the route (the loop rejects it) and `installModelSelection` takes only a context. The recorded `model/selection` event routes the first request; only the prompt variables are still overridden. `tests/role-models.spec.ts` asserts the recorded selection and the first-request route through `AgentModel.current()` over the real `modelSelectionProjectionDefinition`.
  - `tests/sources.spec.ts`: the malformed-line Feishu test uses the `late` fake CLI so the `ready` line cannot be processed after the event lines.
  - `src/client/deployment.tsx`: `ConfigFormSnapshot.mode` is gone; a snapshot with `writable: false` that is not loading is read-only.
- Test typing under the root aggregates: specs and fixtures that import `src/client` are `tests/*.client.spec.ts` (`draft`, `prompt-config`, `markdown`, `navigation`, `locales`) or `.tsx` (`tests/marks.spec.tsx`, `tests/fixtures/panel-server.tsx`, which the aggregates do not check); `<T>(` in `panel-server.tsx` is `<T,>(`. `tests/fixtures/deployment.ts` accepts `undefined` overrides. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and unused-name errors in `cards`, `runtime`, `sources`, `feishu-read`, `model-surface`, `store`, `fixtures/host.ts` and `fixtures/panel-server.tsx` are fixed in place (`as never` on fixture objects, unused names removed, `ConfigFormSnapshot.mode` dropped).
- `package.json` also lists the Cordis include, group and loader plugins as development dependencies, which `tests/bundle-patch.spec.ts` loads.
- Panel specs: `tests/fixtures/panel.tsx` and the nine `tests/panel-*.spec.tsx` import `./fixtures/panel-server.tsx` (renamed from `.ts`). `tests/panel-deployment.spec.tsx` no longer publishes `mode: 'memory'` in the read-only scenario (line 108); the snapshot has no `mode`, and `writable: false` selects the read-only hint.

Files outside the copy changed for S1:

- `tsconfig.base.json`: paths for `@mumbo/superagent`, `@mumbo/superagent/github-watch` and `@mumbo/superagent/feishu-watch`.
- `tsconfig.host.json` and `tsconfig.client.json`: a reference to each leaf of the package.
- `.oxlintrc.json` and `.oxlintrc.staged.json`: `ignorePatterns` entry for `packages/mumbo/superagent/**`.
- `package.json`: root `devDependencies` entry `@mumbo/superagent`, so a Host started from the repository resolves the plugin named in a `--patch` overlay. `apps/cli/package.json` is unchanged because the published CLI must not depend on a private package.
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: the new workspace importer.
- `scripts/package-dependency-policy.ts`: `scopeParentOf` is classified peer-required for `@deepseek-ai/dsh-scope`; `src/app/sessions.ts` reads the scope chain, which is module state of the shared instance.
- Repository gate exclusions, each commented `pinned upstream copy; see packages/mumbo/superagent/UPSTREAM.md`: the coverage `exclude` in `vitest.config.ts`; the scans of `scripts/verify-export-jsdoc.ts`, `scripts/verify-client-ui-i18n.ts`, `scripts/verify-no-unknown-casts.ts`, `scripts/verify-doc-refs.ts` and `scripts/locale-dictionary-parity.spec.ts`; `docs/**` and `SETUP.md` as link sources in `scripts/verify-md-links.ts`; the exported-type index of `scripts/gen-client-catalog.ts`; and, in `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts`, `excludedPackages` (a field of `CordisCatalogPolicy` in `packages/typert/generator/src/cordis-catalog.ts`) and the `orchestrator` entry of `SERVICE_WALK_EXEMPTIONS`.
- `scripts/product-package-policy.ts`: `optional` classification.
- `packages/mumbo/README.md` and its pair: the package row.
- `docs/persistence-changes/2026-11-09-superagent-message-source.md` and its siblings: the `dsh-superagent` message source.
