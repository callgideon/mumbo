# Template: upgrade-guide

Use this kind for `docs/upgrade-guide/v<version>/<item>/guide.md`. The tree has no folder index. [dsh-create-upgrade-guide](../../dsh-create-upgrade-guide/SKILL.md) owns scope, placement, maintenance, and length rules; `pnpm run verify-upgrade-guides` enforces them.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
kind: upgrade-guide
description: "The externally perceptible surface that breaks and what replaces it."

# <Specific break, for example: `--profile` replaces `--preset`>
